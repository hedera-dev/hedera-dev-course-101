# Graded Assessment: TODO_MODULE_NAME

Graded assessment materials for module TODO_MODULE_ID of the Hedera Developer Course.

Status: Note that this module is still a work in progress.
Materials that are not available yet or incomplete are marked with "(WIP)".

## Instructions

This subdirectory within the Hedera Developer Course repo is the starting point,
and you will need to make a fresh copy of it within your own git repository,
and use that repo for submissions.
You **should not** work directly within this repo (it will not graded).

If you have yet to initialise a repo for assessments submissions,
perform the following steps:

```shell
mkdir -p ../hedera-dev-course-101-graded-assessments
git cd hedera-dev-course-101-graded-assessments
git init
```

Copy this subdirectory into your repo for assessment submissions,
like so:

```shell
cp -r ./hdcXYZXYGradedAssessment/ ../hedera-dev-course-101-graded-assessments/hdcXYZXYSubmission/
```

Now you may begin working on your submission for this module!
