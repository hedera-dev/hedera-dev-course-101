## How to run

You may choose to run this demo repo and follow along the tutorial, either:
(a) on your own computer (recommended for experienced developers), or
(b) using Gitpod (recommended for quick/ easy setup).

### How to run on your computer

To run on your own computer, `git clone` this repo,
and follow the instructions in the "pre-requisites" section of the accompanying tutorial.

1. Install all the prerequisite software
1. Run `./util/00-main.sh` and this script will interactively prompt you,
   and populate the values needed in the `.env` file
1. Run `./util/03-get-dependencies.sh` and this script will install the required dependencies
1. Run `./util/04-rpcrelay-run.sh` and this script will run a Hedera JSON-RPC Relay instance
   - Note that this requires `docker` to be available on your system
   - Note that you may delay performing this step until later,
     you only need it for HSCS related sequences
1. Congratulations, you can now move on to the sequences! 🎉

### How to run using Gitpod

To run on Gitpod (a cloud development environment), click the button below:

</a>

1. Wait for Gitpod to load, this should take less than 10 seconds
1. In the VS code terminal, you should see 3 terminals, `rpcrelay_pull`, `rpcrelay_run`, and `main`
1. You do not need to use the `get_deps` and `rpcrelay_run` terminals, simply let them run in the background
1. In the `main` terminal, which is the one that displays by default, a script will interactively prompt you
1. Congratulations, you can now move on to the sequences! 🎉
